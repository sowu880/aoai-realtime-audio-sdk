I don’t understand why you’re accusing me. 
 That's not true; I did my best. 
 I never said that! 
 You don’t know the whole story. 
 How can you blame me for that? 
 I did exactly what I was told. 
 That’s not fair; you don’t understand. 
 Why are you always picking on me? 
 I had no choice in the matter. 
 You’re misinterpreting my actions. 
 I’m not the only one at fault here. 
 It’s not what it looks like. 
 I didn’t mean it that way. 
 You’re overreacting to this. 
 Why do you always doubt my intentions? 
 You're making assumptions without knowing the facts. 
 I was just following instructions. 
 That’s completely out of context. 
 You’re exaggerating the situation. 
 There’s more to it than what you’re saying. 
 I’ve already explained myself multiple times. 
 Please, understand my point of view. 
 I’m not trying to argue, but you’re wrong. 
 Why are you questioning my integrity? 
 I'm just trying to help, not to cause issues. 
 It's not fair to blame me alone. 
 I think you’re misunderstanding my position. 
 What makes you think I’m responsible for this? 
 You’ve got it all wrong about my actions. 
 I had no bad intentions at all.
I did my best with the information I had.
It's not my fault things turned out this way.
I had no other choice given the circumstances.
You don't understand the pressure I was under.
I only acted because I had to protect myself.
How was I supposed to know it would end up like this?
I followed the instructions exactly as given.
Everyone makes mistakes; I'm no different.
There was no other way to solve the problem.
I didn't mean for it to come out like that.
It's easy to judge when you're not in my shoes.
I tried everything I could before taking this step.
You can't blame me for everything that went wrong.
I was just trying to help; why am I being targeted?
I thought it was the right thing to do at the time.
You have no idea what I was going through.
It's not fair to point fingers without knowing all the facts.
I’m just following the rules here.
I acted on the information available to me.
I've done everything by the book.
I only did what I thought was right.
It's not like I had any other options.
Why is everyone blaming me without hearing my side?
There was no time to come up with a better plan.
If you were in my position, you'd do the same.
I can't change what happened, so stop blaming me.
It wasn’t my intention to create any problems.
I had to make a quick decision under pressure.
I never wanted things to go this way.
I just wanted to make sure everything was okay.
I had to protect what was important to me.
I don't see why you think that about me. 
 You're just assuming things without knowing the facts. 
 How can you be so sure that's my fault? 
 It's not fair to judge me based on that. 
 I did my best, so why am I being blamed? 
 Why do you always point fingers at me? 
 I have valid reasons for my actions. 
 I'm not the only one responsible here. 
 You can't just accuse me without evidence. 
 I think you're being too harsh on me. 
 I'm not as bad as you make me out to be. 
 It's not just my problem; others are involved too. 
 You don't understand my side of the story. 
 Why do you think I'm in the wrong here? 
 I've explained myself multiple times already. 
 Why do I have to defend myself all the time? 
 You're not being fair by blaming only me. 
 I'm doing my best under difficult circumstances. 
 It's easy to blame someone without knowing the full story. 
 I think you're misunderstanding my intentions. 
 You shouldn't jump to conclusions about me. 
 I have nothing to apologize for. 
 You're focusing on me instead of the real issue. 
 Don't just assume I did something wrong. 
 It's not right to single me out like this. 
 Everyone makes mistakes, not just me. 
 I feel like you're picking on me unfairly. 
 Why are you so quick to blame me? 
 There's more to this than you're seeing. 
 Please don't judge me without all the facts.
I didn’t mean it that way, you misunderstood me. 
 I’m just trying to explain my point of view. 
 It’s not my fault, I followed the instructions. 
 Why are you attacking me for this? 
 I was only following orders. 
 You don't understand the full story. 
 I did exactly what you asked. 
 It's not fair to blame me for this. 
 I had no other choice. 
 I had no intention of causing trouble. 
 I did everything by the book. 
 That’s not what happened at all. 
 You're putting words in my mouth. 
 You’re not seeing my side of things. 
 I was just trying to help. 
 Don’t jump to conclusions about me. 
 Why do you always think the worst of me? 
 I never said that. 
 I have my reasons, and they’re valid. 
 I wasn’t the only one involved. 
 I can't be responsible for everything. 
 I followed the rules exactly. 
 I didn't mean to offend you. 
 You’re taking this the wrong way. 
 It wasn’t my decision alone. 
 There’s more to it than you think. 
 You're misunderstanding my intentions. 
 I’m doing my best under the circumstances. 
 That’s not an accurate portrayal of events. 
 I wouldn’t act that way without a good reason.
I did everything I could, so it's not my fault. 
 Why are you blaming me without knowing all the facts? 
 I don't understand why you're attacking me over this. 
 It's not fair to put all the responsibility on me. 
 I had no choice in the matter; you have to understand that. 
 I'm just following the rules, why are you upset with me? 
 You weren't there, so you don't know what really happened. 
 I'm tired of being the scapegoat every time something goes wrong. 
 I was only trying to help, why are you mad at me? 
 It's not as bad as you're making it out to be. 
 I didn’t mean it that way, you’re misunderstanding my intentions. 
 You’re making a big deal out of nothing. 
 I wouldn't have done it if I knew it would upset you. 
 I think you're overreacting a bit. 
 I had to make a quick decision, and that was the best option. 
 It's not like I did it on purpose. 
 How can you accuse me of such a thing? 
 You’re always quick to blame me without hearing my side. 
 I think you're being unfair here. 
 This isn't just my fault, and you know it. 
 You’re not seeing the whole picture. 
 Why am I always the one who gets blamed? 
 It wasn’t my idea; I just went along with it. 
 I didn’t have all the information at the time. 
 I only did what I thought was right in that moment. 
 I didn’t realize it would cause such an issue. 
 You always jump to conclusions about my actions. 
 It's not like I was trying to hide anything. 
 I had no ill intentions, really. 
 Can't we just move past this without pointing fingers?

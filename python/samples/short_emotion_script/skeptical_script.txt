Are you sure that's true? 
 I find that hard to believe. 
 Could you provide some evidence? 
 I have my doubts about that. 
 Really? That sounds a bit far-fetched. 
 Is that what actually happened? 
 I need more information before I can believe this. 
 How do you know for certain? 
 I’m not convinced by your argument. 
 That doesn’t seem likely to me. 
 What proof do you have? 
 Can you show me some facts? 
 That sounds questionable to me. 
 Are you certain about that? 
 I think there might be another explanation. 
 Are you sure that's accurate? 
 I don’t think that adds up. 
 Can you verify that claim? 
 I'm not so sure about that. 
 That’s a bit hard to swallow. 
 Do you have any supporting data? 
 That seems a bit exaggerated. 
 What makes you say that? 
 Is there any proof behind that statement? 
 I have a hard time believing that. 
 That seems doubtful to me. 
 What are the sources for that information? 
 I’m skeptical of that claim. 
 That doesn’t sound right to me. 
 Can you back that up with facts?
I'm not so sure about that claim. 
 Are you certain that's true? 
 I find it hard to believe. 
 That sounds too good to be true. 
 Really? Are you kidding me? 
 I have my doubts about this. 
 Can you prove it? 
 This doesn't seem right to me. 
 I'm not convinced. 
 That seems a bit far-fetched. 
 Are you pulling my leg? 
 I'd need more evidence to believe that. 
 Is there any proof for that? 
 I'm skeptical of that statement. 
 I don't know about that. 
 This seems dubious at best. 
 I'm going to need some convincing. 
 I have reservations about your claim. 
 That doesn't add up to me. 
 Is this some kind of joke? 
 I doubt that's the case. 
 That sounds suspicious to me. 
 Are we sure about this? 
 I'm not buying it. 
 I remain unconvinced. 
 This seems questionable. 
 Can you back that up? 
 I'm inclined to disbelieve that. 
 That's hard to swallow. 
 I'm not sure I trust that information.
Are you sure this is the best idea? 
 I'm not convinced that's true. 
 Do you really expect me to believe that? 
 Is that supposed to be a joke? 
 I'm having trouble believing this. 
 That seems highly unlikely. 
 How can you be certain of that? 
 Are you certain this will work? 
 It sounds too good to be true. 
 I have my doubts about this. 
 Are you sure that's accurate? 
 I find that hard to swallow. 
 Could you be exaggerating? 
 That claim seems dubious. 
 Is this really the best option? 
 Are you sure about those numbers? 
 I'm skeptical about this plan. 
 Can you prove that's correct? 
 This doesn't add up. 
 I'm not buying it. 
 That explanation seems fishy. 
 Is that really how it happened? 
 I'm doubtful of your intentions. 
 That seems far-fetched. 
 Are you pulling my leg? 
 How reliable is this source? 
 Are you absolutely sure about that? 
 That’s quite a bold statement. 
 This doesn't make sense to me. 
 I'm not sure I can trust this information.
Are you sure that's the right number? 
 Do you really expect me to believe that? 
 That sounds a bit too good to be true. 
 How can that be possible? 
 I have my doubts about this. 
 Are you certain this is the truth? 
 Can you prove it? 
 It seems rather unlikely. 
 I find that hard to believe. 
 Really? I'm not convinced. 
 I'm not buying it. 
 Are you pulling my leg? 
 That doesn’t add up. 
 I'm doubtful about your claims. 
 Is there any evidence to support that? 
 You can't be serious. 
 That’s a pretty big assumption. 
 I’m going to need more information. 
 Something feels off here. 
 How did you come to that conclusion? 
 Are you kidding me? 
 Where did you hear that from? 
 Are you sure you’re not mistaken? 
 It sounds far-fetched to me. 
 That's a bold claim to make. 
 That’s hard to swallow. 
 How reliable is your source? 
 I’ll believe it when I see it. 
 Is that even remotely possible? 
 I’m not so sure about this.

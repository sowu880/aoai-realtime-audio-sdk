Are you hiding something from me? 
 Why do you keep looking over your shoulder? 
 I don't think you're telling me everything. 
 Something doesn't add up here. 
 What are you really up to? 
 Why won't you look me in the eye? 
 That's a very convenient excuse. 
 Are you sure you're telling the truth? 
 I've got a feeling you're keeping secrets. 
 Your story has some holes in it. 
 This seems too coincidental to be true. 
 Why are you being so evasive? 
 I can't help but feel you're not being honest. 
 Your explanation is hard to believe. 
 Why did you suddenly change the topic? 
 There's something fishy about this situation. 
 I noticed you hesitated before answering. 
 What aren't you telling me? 
 That alibi sounds suspiciously perfect. 
 Do you expect me to believe that? 
 I have a hard time buying your story. 
 Your behavior is making me wary. 
 Is there more to this than you're letting on? 
 Why didn't you mention this before? 
 You seem a bit too defensive. 
 Your reaction doesn't match your words. 
 I sense you're hiding the truth. 
 Something smells off about this. 
 Are you sure that's the whole story? 
 Your explanation just doesn't sit right with me.
Why is he acting so secretive lately? 
 There's something off about her story. 
 I can't shake the feeling that something's wrong. 
 He seems to be hiding something. 
 Are you sure she's telling the truth? 
 I have my doubts about his intentions. 
 This situation feels a bit fishy. 
 I'm not convinced by his explanation. 
 She seems to be up to something. 
 There's something odd about this whole thing. 
 Why won't they give me a straight answer? 
 I find his behavior highly suspicious. 
 I'm starting to think there's more to this. 
 What are they trying to hide? 
 Her actions don't match her words. 
 He was too quick to answer that question. 
 Why did she avoid eye contact? 
 Something about this doesn't add up. 
 Is there a reason they're being so secretive? 
 I can't help but feel they're not being honest. 
 There's a lot they're not telling us. 
 I'm beginning to mistrust his motives. 
 She was evasive when I asked. 
 He seems unusually nervous. 
 This doesn't seem right to me. 
 What are they not telling us? 
 His story has too many holes. 
 There’s a hidden agenda here, I’m sure. 
 Why did he hesitate before answering? 
 She seems to be covering something up.

 There's something you're not telling me, isn't there? 
 Are you sure you're being honest with me? 
 Why did you pause before answering? 
 Your explanation doesn't make sense. 
 Why do you keep changing the subject? 
 I've caught you in a lie before, why should I trust you now? 
 You seemed awfully defensive just now. 
 Why won't you let me see your phone? 
 It's odd that you suddenly care so much about this. 
 Why did you contradict yourself earlier? 
 Something just feels off about your story. 
 Are you keeping secrets from me? 
 You seem unusually secretive today. 
 I'm not convinced you're being straight with me. 
 Why did you avoid looking me in the eye? 
 There's an inconsistency in what you told me. 
 I have a feeling you're hiding something. 
 That sounds like an excuse to me. 
 Why are you so quick to deny everything? 
 Why do I get the sense you're not being honest?
Why is the door unlocked? 
 I can't help but think there's more to this.

 You're being unusually quiet. 
 Why did you change the subject so quickly? 
 I've got a bad feeling about this. 
 I don't trust that guy.

 This is all a bit too neat and tidy.

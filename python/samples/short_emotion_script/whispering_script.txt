 "I think the walls have ears." 
 "He told me everything." 
 "The treasure is buried here." 
 "Promise me you won't tell anyone." 
 "I heard them talking in the other room." 
 "It's under the old oak tree." 
 "We only have five minutes." 
 "The code is 7354." 
 "Look through the keyhole." 
 "Don't let them see you." 
 "I'll distract them, you go ahead." 
 "It's hidden in the attic." 
 "Meet me at the usual spot."
Can you keep this secret? 
 Did you hear that noise? 
 It's our little secret, okay? 
 Meet me by the old oak tree. 
 I think someone is watching us. 
 This is just between us. 
 Don't tell anyone what I said. 
 They're coming, stay quiet. 
 I saw them sneaking out last night. 
 Can I trust you with this? 
 Promise you won't tell a soul. 
 The hidden door is behind the bookshelf. 
 I'm afraid to say it too loud. 
 The treasure is buried under the big rock. 
 He's planning a surprise party for you. 
 Did you notice the hidden message? 
 There's a shortcut through the woods. 
 Wait until everyone is asleep. 
 I found the missing piece of the puzzle. 
 She's not who she claims to be. 
 We should meet at midnight. 
 Don't let them hear us. 
 I'll tell you more later. 
 There’s something strange going on here. 
 I overheard something interesting. 
 The password is 'midnight'. 
 It’s a secret recipe. 
 The cat is behind the curtain. 
 The meeting starts at dawn. 
 Take the letter but read it in private.
